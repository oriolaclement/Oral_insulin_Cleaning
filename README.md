Processes followed in executing this task
Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand the data in detail. So we took the time to understand the data model and domain of your task.
Data extraction - after understanding your Task, we then architected what an ideal dataset should look like for this problem and extracted it from the relevant data sources
Data Wrangling(Gather, Assess, Clean) - After extracting the raw data, we needed to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the questions and produce analytics.
Auralin and Novodra Trials
We will be looking at the phase two clinical trial data of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralin - a proprietary capsule that can solve this stomach lining problem.

Phase two trials are intended to:

Test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug
Identify adverse reactions
In this trial, half of the patients are being treated with Auralin, and the other 175 being treated with a popular injectable insulin called Novodra. By comparing key metrics between these two drugs, we can determine if Auralin is effective.
